# Welcome to this repository! :)

## This is the repository that contains my solution to the 30 day challenge of
## code and design offered by ECX (Engineering Career Expo). 

The files have been numbered according to their days for easy navigation. I hope you find
it useful. If you are a beginner at python or even an intermediate, you'll  definitely
find something useful in it.

E.G:
```
f(["a", "b", "a", "a", 3, 3, 2, "hello", "b"] ) => ["a", "b", 3, 2, "hello"]. #output
```
